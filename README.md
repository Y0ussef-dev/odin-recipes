First Odin Project 

Building a basic recipe website, mainly focused on HTML 

I will have demonstarted a basic understanding in HTML fundamentals by making html files, links, images, and content in said files (website)


FINISHED PROJECT REVIEW
- Fine-tuned my HTML fundamentals
- Got more comfortable with git commands (i.e staging, committing, and pushing)
- No difficulties in completing the project
